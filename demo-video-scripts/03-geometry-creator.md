# Geometry Creator - Product Demo Video Script
**Duration:** ~2 minutes | **Tone:** Visual, awe-inspiring, problem-solving energy

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**[SCREEN: A teacher drawing a lopsided triangle on a whiteboard. Students squinting. One whispers: "Is that a triangle or a mountain?"]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Geometry is the language of the world around us — but teaching it with stick figures on a whiteboard was never going to cut it."

**[SCREEN: Cut to Geometry Creator — a clean quiz with a perfectly rendered 3D cylinder, labeled dimensions, and a question asking for its volume.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"What if every shape was precise, every label was clear, and every question wrote itself?"

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)

**SOUND BITE — Teacher testimonial:**
> *"I would spend 30 minutes in PowerPoint just trying to draw a proper trapezoid with the right measurements. And then I still had to write the questions."*

**[SCREEN: Montage — teacher struggling with shape tools, misaligned labels, a student raising their hand: "Miss, I can't tell which side is 7cm."]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Creating geometry assessments has always meant fighting two battles at once: drawing the shapes and writing the problems. Until now."

## THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:15)

**[SCREEN: Live product walkthrough begins on Geometry Creator page.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Pick your grade level — elementary through college. Choose your geometry types."

**[DEMO: Teacher selects High School, checks Triangles, Circles, and 3D Shapes.]**

"Triangles. Circles. 3D shapes. Volume. Symmetry. Coordinate geometry. Transformations — eleven categories, all available."

**[DEMO: Teacher selects 10 questions, Multiple Choice + Paragraph, 30-minute timer. Clicks Generate.]**

"Set your question count, pick your question types, choose a time limit — and generate."

**[DEMO: Quiz populates. Each question has a rendered geometric shape with labeled measurements — a cone with height and radius, a triangle with marked angles, a circle sector.]**

"The AI generates the questions. The rendering engine draws every shape — 2D and 3D — with accurate measurements, labeled dimensions, and clean visuals."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"I clicked generate and a perfectly labeled triangular prism appeared with a volume question. I almost cried. That would have taken me an hour."*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Don't like a question? Edit it. Change the dimensions. Swap the shape. Or hit regenerate and get a fresh one instantly."

**[DEMO: Teacher clicks Edit on a question. Modal opens — they adjust the radius from 5 to 8. Shape re-renders with new measurements.]**

## STUDENT EXPERIENCE (1:15 - 1:35)

**[SCREEN: Student opens geometry quiz on a tablet. Clean layout — shape on one side, question on the other.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Students see professional-quality diagrams — not clipart, not hand-drawn guesses. Real geometry."

**[DEMO: Student taps on a shape image. It enlarges in a modal for closer inspection.]**

"They can tap to enlarge any shape. Every measurement is readable. Every angle is labeled."

**[DEMO: Student answers a paragraph question about calculating cone volume. Hint appears: "Use formula: V = (1/3)πr²h"]**

"Built-in formula hints guide students through calculations without giving away the answer."

**[DEMO: Competition mode — leaderboard appears showing student rankings after submission.]**

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"My students started competing to finish the geometry quiz first. Geometry. Competing. I never thought I'd say those words together."*

## TEACHER POWER FEATURES (1:35 - 1:48)

**[SCREEN: Teacher dashboard showing quiz scores, analytics by geometry type, difficulty breakdown.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Run it relaxed, as a competition with a live leaderboard, or in collaboration mode where teams solve together. After they submit, your dashboard shows scores, time spent, and performance by geometry category — so you know exactly where your class needs more practice."

**[DEMO: Print preview mode — clean printable worksheet with shapes and questions. Teacher clicks Print.]**

"And if you need paper? One click gives you a print-ready version — shapes, questions, and answer spaces included."

---

## CLOSING (1:48 - 2:00)

**[SCREEN: Gallery of rendered shapes — sphere, hexagon, coordinate plane, transformation diagram — all clean and labeled.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Geometry Creator. Eleven shape categories. AI-powered questions. Perfectly rendered diagrams. Because geometry deserves to look as beautiful as the math behind it."

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]:**
**Deciph.AI — Where shapes meet intelligence.**

**[FADE TO BLACK]**
