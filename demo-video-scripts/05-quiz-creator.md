# Quiz Creator - Product Demo Video Script
**Duration:** ~2 minutes | **Tone:** Dynamic, versatile, the Swiss Army knife energy

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**[SCREEN: Three scenes in quick succession — a teacher typing quiz questions one by one in a word processor, another teacher photocopying quizzes, a third teacher hand-grading a stack of papers with a red pen.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Write the questions. Print the copies. Hand them out. Collect them. Grade them. Record the scores. Repeat — for every class, every week, every year."

**[SCREEN: Cut to Quiz Creator — a quiz generated, shared, taken, and graded — all on screen in a seamless flow.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Or — do all of that in two minutes. And never touch a red pen again."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)

**SOUND BITE — Teacher testimonial:**
> *"I teach four classes. That is four quizzes a week. Twenty questions each. I was spending more time making quizzes than teaching the material they were testing."*

**[SCREEN: Calculator tallying: 4 classes x 20 questions x 52 weeks = 4,160 questions per year.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Assessment should measure learning — not consume the time meant for it."

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:10)

**[SCREEN: Quiz Creator interface — clean form with clear options.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Start with a topic, a text passage, or upload a file — PDF, Word, or plain text."

**[DEMO: Teacher types "The American Revolution" as the topic. Selects High School. Checks Multiple Choice, True/False, and Select All That Apply.]**

"Pick your grade level. Choose your question types — multiple choice, true or false, paragraph response, or select all that apply. Mix them however you want."

**[DEMO: Teacher sets 15 questions, 25-minute timer. Clicks Generate Quiz.]**

"Set the count, set the timer, and generate."

**[DEMO: Quiz preview appears — 15 questions with clean formatting. Multiple choice options labeled A through D. True/false questions. A paragraph question with space for written response.]**

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"Fifteen quality questions from a topic name. Fifteen. I checked them — they were better than what I would have written at 10pm the night before the test."*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Every question is editable. Regenerate any single question without losing the rest. Add your own. Remove what you don't need."

**[DEMO: Teacher clicks Regenerate on question 7. New question appears. Teacher clicks Edit on question 12, adjusts the wording. Saves.]**

## THREE WAYS TO PLAY (1:10 - 1:35)

**[SCREEN: Mode selection — Relaxed, Competition, Collaboration — each with distinct visual identity.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Now here's where it gets interesting. You don't just create a quiz — you choose how students experience it."

**[DEMO: Relaxed Mode — Student takes quiz at their own pace. Clean, calm interface.]**

"**Relaxed Mode** — the classic individual assessment. Focused. Personal. No pressure beyond the content."

**[DEMO: Competition Mode — Leaderboard visible. Students' names and scores ranked in real time. Winners board appears at the end.]**

"**Competition Mode** — a live leaderboard. Students see where they stand. Scores update after every submission. It turns a Tuesday quiz into the most engaged 20 minutes of the week."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"I turned on competition mode once as an experiment. My students literally cheered when the leaderboard appeared. Now they ask me — every week — 'Is it competition day?'"*

**[DEMO: Collaboration Mode — Team selection screen. Teams named Red, Blue, Green. Students join their team. Team score combines the best answers from each member.]**

"**Collaboration Mode** — students work in teams. The best answer from any team member counts for the group. It rewards participation and turns every student into a contributor."

## GRADING & ANALYTICS (1:35 - 1:48)

**[SCREEN: Student submits quiz. Instant results — green checkmarks, red X's, score badge.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Multiple choice and true or false — graded instantly. Paragraph answers? The AI reads them, evaluates the reasoning, and gives detailed feedback."

**[DEMO: Paragraph evaluation — "Strong response. You correctly identified the causes, but consider expanding on the economic factors. 8/10."]**

"Students don't just see right or wrong — they see why."

**[DEMO: Teacher dashboard — quiz management table with search, date filters, score views. Analytics showing score distributions and performance trends.]**

"On your dashboard: every quiz, every score, every trend. Filter by date. Search by topic. See which questions your class found hardest."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"The analytics showed me that 80% of my students missed questions about primary sources. I would never have caught that pattern grading by hand. I restructured my next two lessons around it."*

---

## CLOSING (1:48 - 2:00)

**[SCREEN: Quick montage — Quiz generated. Link shared. Students on phones and laptops. Leaderboard updating. Teacher reviewing analytics. All seamless.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Quiz Creator. Generate from a topic, a document, or your own content. Deliver it relaxed, competitive, or collaborative. Grade it instantly. Understand what your students know — and what they need next."

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]:**
**Deciph.AI — Assessment that teaches back.**
