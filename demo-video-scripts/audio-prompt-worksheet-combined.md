## PROMPT FOR AI AUDIO GENERATOR

Generate a warm, confident, conversational narration — the voice of someone who deeply respects teachers and cares about students. Pacing should feel like a TED talk meets a product reveal: unhurried at the emotional beats, brisk during the feature descriptions. Natural pauses between sections. No robotic cadence. This is one continuous narrator — no character switches.

## SCRIPT (90 seconds)

Deciph.AI is an AI-powered teaching assistant that lets educators create, share, and auto-grade worksheets — in under two minutes. No more late nights formatting questions. No more stacks of ungraded papers. No more students waiting a week just to find out what they got wrong.

Here is how it works.

You upload what you already have — a photo of a textbook page, a diagram, a whiteboard snapshot, or a YouTube link. The AI reads your content and generates questions instantly. Multiple choice. True or false. Open-ended. Or a mix of all three. Every question comes with an expected answer already filled in. Edit them, add your own, or accept them as they are.

Set a timer. Enable extra time for students who need accommodations. And hit create.

You get a shareable link and a QR code. Students scan it, open the worksheet on any device, and start — no logins, no downloads, no friction.

Now here is where it changes everything — for the student.

They see the images and videos you uploaded right alongside the questions. It is not just a test — it is context they can learn from. A live countdown keeps them focused. And if they need more time, one tap requests the extra minutes you already approved — no hand-raising, no embarrassment.

Turn on Auto Navigation mode and the experience transforms. Students answer one question at a time. Get it right — and confetti bursts across the screen. A voice says "Brilliant!" It is not just a checkmark. It is a moment that tells them: you understood this.

Get it wrong — and there is no shame. Just a gentle message: "Not quite, but you are learning. Want to try again?"

When they submit, the AI does not just count right and wrong. It reads every answer and responds the way a great teacher would. Correct answers get specific praise — "You clearly understand photosynthesis. The chloroplast is exactly right." Wrong answers get an explanation, not a penalty — "Close. Osmosis moves water, not solutes. Review the diagram and you will see it."

On your end, you see every submission, every score, every response — who finished, who needed extra time, and how long each student spent. Real data. Zero paper. Zero grading.
