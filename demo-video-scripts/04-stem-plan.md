# STEM Lesson Plan - Product Demo Video Script
**Duration:** ~2 minutes | **Tone:** Authoritative yet warm, educator empowerment, the feeling of "finally"

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**[SCREEN: Teacher at 11pm, laptop open, tabs everywhere — curriculum standards in one, a blank Google Doc in another, YouTube search in a third. Coffee gone cold.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"It is Sunday night. The lesson is tomorrow. You know the topic. You know the standard. But the plan? The plan is still a blank page."

**[SCREEN: Cut to STEM Plan — a complete, beautifully structured lesson plan fills the screen. Graphs, formulas, worked examples, practice problems, all generated.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"What if that blank page filled itself — with everything you need, and nothing you don't?"

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)

**SOUND BITE — Teacher testimonial:**
> *"Writing a proper STEM lesson plan takes me two to three hours. Objectives, examples, practice problems, finding a good video — and then I still have to think about assessment. Every. Single. Lesson."*

**[SCREEN: Calendar view showing five days of classes. Each day with a different topic. The weight of it visible.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"STEM teachers do not just teach — they engineer every lesson from the ground up. Five subjects. Five levels of rigor. One teacher."

## THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:15)

**[SCREEN: STEM Plan creation form — clean, minimal.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Pick your subject."

**[DEMO: Teacher selects Physics from the dropdown — Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, General Science all visible.]**

"Choose your topic, grade level, duration, and difficulty."

**[DEMO: Teacher types "Newton's Laws of Motion", selects High School, 50 minutes, Intermediate.]**

"Select the features you want in your plan."

**[DEMO: Feature checkboxes — all checked: Step-by-Step Solutions, Auto-Generate Graphs, Worked Examples, Practice Problems, Key Formulas, Fun Facts, Inspirational Quotes, Real-World Applications, Visual Aids, Interactive Evaluation, Assessment Methods.]**

"Step-by-step solutions. Auto-generated graphs. Worked examples. Practice problems at three difficulty levels. Key formulas. Real-world applications. Assessment strategies. Even an inspirational quote to start the lesson. All of it — or just the parts you need."

**[DEMO: Teacher clicks Generate. Loading animation plays. Full lesson plan appears.]**

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"I hit generate and a complete lesson appeared — objectives, formulas, two worked examples, five practice problems, a graph of projectile motion, and a YouTube video. I just sat there staring at it."*

**[DEMO: Scrolling through the generated plan — clean sections with icons. Learning objectives. Key formulas with proper notation. Step-by-step method. Lesson notes. Worked examples showing basic and advanced solutions.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"The AI writes rigorous, subject-specific content. Not generic filler — real formulas, real calculations, real science."

**[DEMO: Dynamic graph showing velocity-time relationship for Newton's Second Law. Data points plotted, axes labeled.]**

"Graphs are generated from actual equations — not stock images. Kinematics, wave functions, titration curves, enzyme kinetics — whatever the subject demands."

## INTERACTIVE EVALUATION (1:15 - 1:30)

**[SCREEN: Interactive evaluation section of the lesson plan.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Every plan comes with a built-in evaluation — five question types designed to test real understanding."

**[DEMO: Quick cuts — Multiple choice question. Drag-and-drop matching (terms to definitions). Ordering question (arrange steps of the scientific method). Paragraph question with rubric.]**

"Multiple choice. Drag-and-drop matching. Sequencing. Open-ended paragraphs with scoring rubrics. Students answer directly in the lesson — and get instant results."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"I used to make the lesson plan, then make the quiz separately. Now the assessment is already built in. That alone saves me an hour."*

---

## SHARE & REUSE (1:30 - 1:45)

**[SCREEN: Teacher clicks Share. Link generated and copied. Another tab shows the shared lesson — public, beautiful, accessible.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Share your plan with a single link — colleagues, substitutes, or students. Download it as a PDF. Or keep it in your library and reuse it next semester."

**[DEMO: Shared lesson view — gradient header, structured sections, professional formatting. No login required to view.]**

"Anyone with the link sees a polished, professional lesson. No login required."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"I shared a chemistry plan with my department. Three teachers used it that week. One said it was better than anything she'd written in fifteen years. We both laughed — and then we both got a little emotional about it."*

## CLOSING (1:45 - 2:00)

**[SCREEN: Five subject icons — Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, General Science — each glowing as the narrator names them.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Mathematics. Physics. Chemistry. Biology. General Science. From elementary to college level. Complete lesson plans with graphs, examples, problems, and assessment — generated in seconds, refined by you."

**[SCREEN: Teacher closing laptop at a reasonable hour. Smiling.]**

"STEM Plan. Because the best teachers don't need to work until midnight — they need tools that work as hard as they do."

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]:**
**Deciph.AI — Lesson planning, intelligently solved.**
