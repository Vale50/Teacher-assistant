**Duration:** ~2 minutes | **Tone:** Warm, empowering, teacher-first

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**[SCREEN: Teacher at desk, surrounded by textbooks, staring at a blank document. Clock ticking.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"You became a teacher to inspire minds — not to spend your Sunday nights building worksheets from scratch."

**[SCREEN: Cut to Deciph.AI Create Worksheet landing page — clean, inviting interface.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"What if you could turn any image, any video, any idea into a ready-to-share worksheet — in under two minutes?"

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)

**SOUND BITE — Teacher testimonial style (on camera or V.O.):**
> *"I used to spend an hour per worksheet. Finding images, typing questions, formatting answers — and then doing it all over again for a different class."*

**[SCREEN: Quick montage — copy-pasting, reformatting, printing, repeat.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Teachers spend an average of 7 hours a week on materials prep. That is time stolen from what matters most — your students."

## THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:15)

**[SCREEN: Live product walkthrough begins.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"With Create Worksheet, you start by uploading what you already have."

**[DEMO: Teacher drags an image of a biology diagram into the upload area. A YouTube link is pasted alongside it.]**

"Drop in a photo of a textbook page, a lab diagram, a map — or paste a YouTube link. The AI reads it all."

**[DEMO: AI panel appears. Teacher selects 10 questions, Medium difficulty, Mixed format.]**

"Choose your question count, difficulty level, and format — multiple choice, true or false, open-ended, or a mix of all three. Then hit Generate."

**[DEMO: Questions populate in real-time with answers pre-filled. Teacher scrolls through them.]**

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"The first time it generated questions from a photo of my whiteboard, I literally said out loud — 'How did it know that?'"*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Every question comes with an expected answer. Edit any of them, add your own, or accept them as-is."

**[DEMO: Teacher sets a 20-minute timer, enables Extra Time for accommodations, and clicks Create Worksheet.]**

"Set a timer. Enable extra time for students who need it. And create."

**[DEMO: Success modal appears with a shareable link and a QR code.]**

"Instantly get a shareable link and a QR code. Students scan, open, and start — no logins, no downloads, no friction."

---

## THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE (1:15 - 1:35)

**[SCREEN: Student phone scanning QR code. Worksheet loads with images, timer counting down.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Students see the media you uploaded, answer questions in real time, and when they submit — the AI evaluates every answer with personalized, encouraging feedback."

**[DEMO: Student submits. Feedback appears: "Great job! You clearly understand photosynthesis. The chloroplast is exactly right."]**

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"My students told me the feedback felt like it came from me. That's when I knew this was different."*

**[DEMO: In Auto Navigation mode — student answers correctly, confetti bursts on screen.]**

"Turn on Auto Navigation mode and every correct answer becomes a celebration."

## THE IMPACT (1:35 - 1:50)

**[SCREEN: Teacher dashboard showing student submissions, scores, and analytics.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"On your end, you see every submission, every score, every response — all in one place. No more collecting papers. No more manual grading."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"I got my evenings back. But honestly? What changed is that my students actually look forward to worksheets now."*

---

## CLOSING (1:50 - 2:00)

**[SCREEN: Create Worksheet interface with tagline overlay.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Create Worksheet. Upload your content. Let AI do the heavy lifting. Give your students something worth completing."
