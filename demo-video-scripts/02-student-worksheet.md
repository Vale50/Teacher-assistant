## OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**[SCREEN: A student stares at a crumpled paper worksheet with no feedback, no marks — just a grade at the top. They look defeated.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"A grade tells a student what they got. It never tells them what they understood — or where they lost their way."

**[SCREEN: Cut to a student opening a worksheet on their phone — bright, clean, interactive.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Student Worksheet changes that. Every answer gets a response. Every student gets seen."

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)

**SOUND BITE — Student perspective (on camera or V.O.):**
> *"I'd turn in my worksheet and get it back a week later with a number on top. I never knew why I got something wrong — I just knew I did."*

**[SCREEN: Stack of ungraded papers on a teacher's desk. Clock fast-forwarding.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Traditional worksheets are a one-way street. Students submit and wait. Teachers grade and return. Nobody wins."

## THE SOLUTION — STUDENT EXPERIENCE (0:30 - 1:10)

**[SCREEN: Student scans a QR code from the board. Worksheet loads on their tablet.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Students access their worksheet with a single scan — no app to install, no account to create."

**[DEMO: Worksheet loads — images of a science experiment are on the left, questions on the right. Timer ticking at the top.]**

"They see the same images and videos their teacher uploaded — it is not just questions on a page, it is context they can study."

**[DEMO: Student types their name, starts answering. Multiple choice, true/false, and text inputs visible.]**

"Questions come in formats that keep them engaged — type an answer, pick from choices, or decide true or false."

**[DEMO: Timer bar changes from blue to yellow to red as time runs low.]**

"A live countdown keeps them focused. And if a student needs more time — one click requests the extra minutes their teacher already approved."

**[DEMO: Student clicks 'Request Extra Time' — timer adds 10 minutes. Student exhales with relief.]**

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"The extra time button made me feel like someone actually thought about me when they made this. I didn't have to raise my hand and feel embarrassed."*

## AUTO NAVIGATION MODE (1:10 - 1:30)

**[SCREEN: Switch to Auto Navigation mode. One question on screen. Student answers correctly.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"In Auto Navigation mode, students tackle one question at a time. Get it right —"

**[DEMO: Confetti explodes. Overlay says "Brilliant!" with a burst of color. Audio plays celebratory chime.]**

"— and the screen celebrates them. Not just a checkmark. A moment that says: you got this."

**[DEMO: Student gets the next one wrong. Gentle message: "Not quite — but you're learning. Want to try again?"]**

"Get it wrong, and there is no shame. Just a gentle nudge and another chance."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"My 8-year-old asked me if she could do more worksheets. I had to sit down for a minute after that one."*

## AI FEEDBACK & RESULTS (1:30 - 1:45)

**[SCREEN: Student clicks Submit. Loading spinner. Results appear.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"When they submit, the AI does not just count right and wrong. It reads every answer and responds — like a teacher would."

**[DEMO: Feedback cards appear. Green card: "Excellent — you nailed the difference between mitosis and meiosis." Red card: "Close! Osmosis moves water, not solutes. Review the diagram and you'll see it."]**

"Correct answers get specific praise. Wrong answers get an explanation, not a penalty."

**SOUND BITE:**
> *"For the first time, my students are reading their feedback. Not just looking at the score — actually reading why they got something right or wrong."*

---

## TEACHER VISIBILITY (1:45 - 1:52)

**[SCREEN: Teacher dashboard — student names, scores, time taken, extra time usage, auto-submit flags.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"And teachers see everything: who submitted, what they scored, how long they spent, and whether they needed extra time. Real data. Zero paper."

---

## CLOSING (1:52 - 2:00)

**[SCREEN: Split — student smiling at their results on the left, teacher reviewing submissions on the right.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
"Student Worksheet. Where every answer matters — and every student knows it."

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]:**
**Deciph.AI — Because feedback should not take a week.**

**[FADE TO BLACK]**
