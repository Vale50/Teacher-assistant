## PRE-SESSION (While waiting for attendees to join)

*[Share screen showing the Deciph.AI welcome page. Upbeat background music playing softly.]*

**Chat message to pin:**
> Welcome to the Deciph.AI Product Review! While we wait to start, drop in the chat: What is the ONE task that eats up most of your planning time each week? We'd love to hear!

---

## OPENING (2-3 minutes)

*[Music fades. Camera on. Warm smile.]*

Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome, welcome, welcome.

First of all -- I just want to say... *thank you*. I know your time is the most precious currency you have. You spend it on lesson plans, on marking, on that one student who keeps asking "but *why* do we need algebra?" -- so the fact that you're spending some of it here with us today? That genuinely means the world.

Before we dive in, let me hit you with a fun fact to set the mood:

> **Did you know that the average teacher makes about 1,500 decisions per day? That's roughly four decisions every minute during a school day. Fighter jet pilots make fewer split-second decisions than you do.**

Let that sink in. You're not just educators -- you're *decision athletes*. And what we've built at Deciph.AI? It's designed to take a big chunk of those 1,500 decisions off your plate so you can focus on what actually matters -- that spark in a student's eyes when something finally clicks.

So today, I'm going to walk you through four tools that I believe will genuinely change how your week feels. Not just what you *do*, but how it *feels* to do it. Because teaching should feel like flying -- not like filing.

Here's our lineup:

1. **Quiz Creator** -- Your new assessment co-pilot
2. **Geometry Creator** -- Making shapes come alive
3. **STEM Lesson Planner** -- Lesson plans that practically write themselves
4. **Worksheet Creator** -- Turn any image into an interactive worksheet

Let's go!

---

## PRODUCT 1: QUIZ CREATOR (5-7 minutes)

*[Screen share: Quiz Creator page]*

Alright, let's start with the one thing every teacher needs but nobody has enough time for -- **assessments**.

Think about the last time you sat down to write a quiz. You had to come up with the questions, write the options, make sure the distractors were plausible but not *too* tricky, balance the difficulty... it's like cooking a five-course meal when all you wanted was a sandwich.

**The Quiz Creator is your sous chef.**

You tell it *what* you want, it prepares the ingredients, and you plate it however you like.

### Here's what it does:

**You give it a topic, a grade level, and the number of questions you want.** That's it. Our AI generates a complete, ready-to-share quiz in seconds.

But here's where it gets really interesting...

### Question Types -- Something for Everyone

- **Multiple Choice** -- the classic
- **True/False** -- quick and snappy
- **Paragraph** -- for when you want them to actually *think*
- **All That Apply** -- because real life rarely has just one right answer

### Three Quiz Modes -- This is the Game-Changer

*[Click through each mode on screen]*

1. **Relaxed Mode** -- Standard. Individual. No drama. Perfect for formative assessment.

2. **Competition Mode** -- Now we're talking! This adds a *live leaderboard*. Students see their ranking in real time. I've seen quiet classrooms turn into the World Cup with this one. It's healthy competition that drives engagement.

3. **Collaboration Mode** -- And this is my personal favourite. You can split students into 2 to 5 teams. Think of it like a pub quiz for your classroom. Team Red vs Team Blue. Students discuss, debate, and submit together. It builds communication skills *while* reinforcing the content.

> **Soundbyte:** "Competition mode turns your quiz into a stadium. Collaboration mode turns it into a think tank. Either way -- students *want* to participate."

### Share in One Click

Once your quiz is ready, you hit share, copy the link, send it to students. Done. They open it on their phone, tablet, laptop -- anywhere.

And here's the kicker -- **every score feeds directly into your Performance Dashboard**. You see who's excelling, who's struggling, and where the gaps are -- without marking a single paper.

*[Pause]*

Quick show of hands in the chat -- or just drop a number: **How many hours a week do you currently spend creating and marking quizzes?** Just curious. Drop it in the chat.

*[Wait 10-15 seconds for responses]*

Right. Now imagine cutting that in half. That's what we're after.

---

## PRODUCT 2: GEOMETRY CREATOR (5-7 minutes)

*[Screen share: Geometry Creator page]*

Now, raise your hand if you've ever tried to draw a perfect parallelogram on a whiteboard and it ended up looking like a sad kite.

*[Laugh]*

Yeah. Me too. Every time.

**The Geometry Creator exists because math is visual, and our tools should be too.**

Think of this as a specialised branch of the Quiz Creator -- but built *specifically* for the world of shapes, angles, and spatial reasoning.

### Here's what makes it special:

**Ten geometry categories**, each expandable, each packed with sub-topics:

- Triangles -- properties, types, calculations
- Quadrilaterals -- rectangles, squares, parallelograms, trapezoids
- Circles -- circumference, area, sectors, arcs
- Polygons -- hexagons, pentagons, octagons
- 3D Shapes -- cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones
- Volume & Surface Area
- Angles -- acute, obtuse, right, reflex
- Similarity & Congruence
- Symmetry
- Coordinate Geometry

You just *tick the topics you want*, set the grade level, set the number of questions, and the AI generates a geometry-specific quiz with appropriate diagrams and calculations.

> **Analogy:** "If the Quiz Creator is a Swiss Army knife, the Geometry Creator is a precision compass. It does one thing, and it does it beautifully."

### The Print Preview -- A Hidden Gem

Here's something teachers have told us they love: the **editable print preview**. You can generate the quiz, open the print view, and *directly edit any question on screen* before printing. No going back to the editor. No re-generating. Just click, tweak, print.

It's like having a Word document and a quiz engine in one.

### For the Classroom

You can:
- Set time limits per quiz
- Add your academy or school name for branding
- Copy the link and send it to students instantly
- Track scores in the dashboard

> **Soundbyte:** "Geometry used to mean 'I'll draw it on the board and hope for the best.' Now it means 'I'll generate it in 30 seconds and it'll actually look like a triangle.'"

## PRODUCT 3: STEM LESSON PLANNER (5-7 minutes)

*[Screen share: STEM Plan page]*

Alright, let's talk about the elephant in every staffroom... **lesson planning**.

You know that feeling on a Sunday evening when you're staring at a blank lesson plan template, wondering where the weekend went? We've all been there. It's the teaching equivalent of writer's block, and it's *exhausting*.

**The STEM Lesson Planner is your co-teacher who never calls in sick.**

Here's how it works: you give it a topic, a grade level, a duration, and a difficulty level. Then you select from **eleven content features** -- and this is where it gets magical.

### The Eleven Features -- Pick and Mix

*[Click through each one on screen]*

1. **Step-by-Step Solutions** -- Detailed walkthroughs your students can follow
2. **Auto-Generate Graphs** -- Mathematical visualizations created automatically
3. **Worked Examples** -- Solved problems with full explanations
4. **Practice Problems** -- Ready-made exercises for students
5. **Key Formulas** -- A formula reference sheet, built in
6. **Fun Facts** -- Did you know pi has been calculated to over 100 trillion digits? Neither did your students, and they'll love it
7. **Inspirational Quotes** -- A little motivation goes a long way
8. **Real-World Applications** -- "When will I ever use this?" Never again.
9. **Visual Aids** -- Diagrams, charts, illustrations
10. **Interactive Evaluation** -- Built-in engagement assessment
11. **Assessment Methods** -- Evaluation strategies baked right into the plan

You can select all of them, or just the ones you need. It's a buffet, not a set menu.

> **Analogy:** "Think of the STEM Planner like a LEGO set. Every brick is there. You decide what you build. Maybe today it's a castle. Maybe tomorrow it's a spaceship. The pieces are always ready."

### Share & Download

Once generated, you can:
- **Share the lesson** with a public link -- perfect for supply teachers or co-planners
- **Download it** as a document for your records
- **Open it in a new tab** to review alongside your other materials

> **Soundbyte:** "We didn't build a lesson plan *template*. We built a lesson plan *engine*. You press go, and it drives."

*[Pause]*

Quick poll time! Drop a "1" in the chat if you typically spend MORE than an hour on a single lesson plan. Drop a "2" if it's less than an hour. Let's see where we land.

*[Wait for responses]*

For the "1"s -- we're coming for that hour. In a good way.

---

## PRODUCT 4: WORKSHEET CREATOR (5-7 minutes)

*[Screen share: Worksheet Creator page]*

Now, this one... this one I'm particularly proud of. Because this solves a problem that I haven't seen anyone else tackle.

**How many of you have a stack of worksheet images -- PDFs, photos of textbook pages, screenshots from resources -- that you wish you could turn into interactive, auto-marked assignments?**

That's exactly what the Worksheet Creator does.

> **Analogy:** "It's like having a teaching assistant who can look at any image of a worksheet and say, 'I've got this -- I'll turn it into an interactive quiz, mark it for you, and send you the scores.' That assistant exists now. It's called Deciph.AI."

### Here's the Magic:

**Step 1:** Upload an image. Drag and drop, or click to select. You can even paste a YouTube video URL if your worksheet is video-based.

**Step 2:** Choose your generation mode:
- **Generate Questions** -- The AI *reads* the image, extracts the content, and creates complete questions with answers
- **Generate Answers Only** -- If the questions are already on the worksheet, it just provides the solutions

**Step 3:** Customise everything:
- Number of questions
- Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Answer format (Multiple Choice, Short Answer, Paragraph)
- Question types (Factual, Descriptive, Analytical)
- Time limits with optional extra time allowance
- Display mode (one question at a time, or all at once)

**Step 4:** Share the link with students. They complete it on any device. Scores come directly to your dashboard.

### The Performance Loop -- This is Where It All Connects

And here's the full-circle moment -- when a student submits a worksheet, their scores flow directly into the **Quiz Management Dashboard** and the **Performance Analytics page**. The same place your quiz scores, geometry scores, and flashcard results live.

**One dashboard. Every assessment type. Complete visibility.**

You see the student's name, their score, their time taken, whether they used extra time. And the AI provides personalised feedback to each student -- not just "correct" or "incorrect", but encouraging, teacher-like responses.

> **Soundbyte:** "The Worksheet Creator doesn't just digitise your worksheets. It *brings them to life*. It marks them, tracks them, and tells you exactly where every student stands -- while you sip your tea."

### The Login Prompt -- Thoughtful Design

One thing we've just added: when someone opens a student worksheet link, if they're not logged in, after a couple of seconds they'll see a gentle prompt:

*"Sign in to unlock full access -- view student scores & performance reports, access the Lesson Plan Creator, Geometry Shapes & Graphs, and the Flashcard Creator."*

With a **Login** button and a **Cancel** button. Non-intrusive. No forced redirects. Just an invitation.

Because we respect that the student needs to complete the worksheet. But we also want to gently remind the teacher viewing it: "Hey, there's a whole world of tools waiting for you."

## THE BIGGER PICTURE (2-3 minutes)

*[Camera on. No screen share.]*

So let me zoom out for a second -- pun intended.

What we've built isn't just four separate tools. It's an **ecosystem**.

- You **plan** with the STEM Lesson Planner
- You **create** with the Quiz Creator and Geometry Creator
- You **assign** with the Worksheet Creator
- You **track** everything on the Performance Dashboard
- Students get **instant feedback** powered by AI

It's the full teaching cycle -- Plan, Create, Assign, Track, Improve -- in one platform.

> **Analogy:** "Before Deciph.AI, your teaching tools were like a drawer full of mismatched cutlery. A fork here, a spoon there, a mystery gadget in the back. We've given you the full matching set -- and it all fits in one drawer."

And the best part? Every tool talks to every other tool. Worksheet scores show up in the same dashboard as quiz scores. Lesson plans feed into assessment creation. It's not a collection of tools. It's a **system**.

---

## AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT & FEEDBACK (5-7 minutes)

*[Camera on. Warm, open posture.]*

Alright. That's the tour. But honestly -- the most important part of today's session is what happens *right now*.

Because we didn't build this in a vacuum. We built it for *you*. And the people who know what teachers need... are teachers.

So I'd love to open the floor. And please, don't be shy -- whether it's a question, a suggestion, or even a "that's great BUT..." -- we want to hear it all.

Here are some prompts to get us going:

1. **Which of the four tools would make the biggest difference in your day-to-day?** Drop it in the chat or unmute.

2. **Is there a feature you wish you'd seen that wasn't there?** Maybe something like "I wish the Quiz Creator could also generate homework assignments" or "Can the Geometry Creator handle trigonometry?"

3. **How do you currently handle the assessment-to-feedback loop?** Is it all manual? Do you use another tool? What's broken about it?

4. **If you could wave a magic wand and add one feature to any of these tools, what would it be?**

5. **For those of you who teach subjects outside of STEM -- what would a Deciph.AI tool for YOUR subject look like?**

*[Allow 5-7 minutes for open discussion. Acknowledge each response. Take notes visibly.]*

Thank you. Seriously. Every single piece of feedback you've shared today goes directly into our product roadmap. This isn't a formality -- we're literally building the next features based on conversations exactly like this one.

---

## CLOSING (2 minutes)

Before we wrap up, one more fun fact for the road:

> **According to UNESCO, by 2030, the world will need 69 million new teachers. That's roughly the entire population of the UK. So if you're in this call, you're not just doing a job -- you're part of one of the most critical professions on the planet.**

And our mission at Deciph.AI is simple: **make the hardest job in the world a little easier, a little smarter, and a lot more enjoyable.**

Thank you for your time today. Thank you for what you do every single day in your classrooms. And thank you for trusting us to be part of your teaching journey.

If you want to try any of these tools right now, the platform is live. And if you have questions later, feedback at 2am when you're marking papers -- yes, we know that happens -- reach out. We're here.

Have a wonderful rest of your day. Keep being extraordinary.

*[Wave. Smile. End.]*
